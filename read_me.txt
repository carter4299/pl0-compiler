	To compile & run this code, first download the compiler.c file and any requisite 
input files to the same directory.

	Use "gcc -g compiler.c" to generate a program file from the .c file.
You can now run the program while passing in your input file with this 
command: "./a.out <your input file>.txt".

	During runtime, insert any required values into the terminal to progress 
the program until the HLT command is reached.The expected output will be shown directly in the terminal.
If the program contains no errors, then a file named 'elf.txt' will be created providing input for vm.c.
